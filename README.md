This script filters lines from a text file (combo.txt) and writes only specific lines to a new file (filtered.txt). Here’s how it works:
Symbols List: The script starts by defining a list of special symbols (symbols = ['@', ':', ';', '|', '#', '%', '!', '*']).
File Names: It specifies the input file (combo.txt) and the output file (filtered.txt).
Reading and Filtering: It opens both files:
For each line in the input file (combo.txt), it removes any extra whitespace.
It checks if the line contains a colon (:). If it does, the line is split into two parts: email and password.
It then checks if the password contains any of the symbols from the list.
If the password includes any of these symbols, the entire line is written to the output file (filtered.txt).
In short, this script helps filter email-password combinations where the password contains specific special characters. It’s useful for identifying or processing login credentials that meet certain criteria.
Example of how it works:
If a line in combo.txt is user@example.com:Pa$$w0rd!, it will be written to filtered.txt because Pa$$w0rd! contains the symbols !.
If a line is user2@example.com:password123, it will not be written to filtered.txt because password123 does not contain any of the specified symbols.
